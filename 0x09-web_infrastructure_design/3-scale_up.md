Specifics:
Load Balancer Cluster (HAProxy): Configured as a cluster to ensure redundancy and high availability. If one load balancer fails, the others can take over, preventing service interruption.

Split Components on Separate Servers: Distributing components on separate servers enhances fault tolerance, scalability, and maintainability. If one component fails or requires scaling, it can be done independently without affecting others.

Why Additional Elements:
Load Balancer Cluster: Added to ensure that even if one load balancer fails, others can handle incoming traffic. It avoids a single point of failure and ensures continuous service availability.

Separate Servers for Components: Enhances scalability and fault tolerance. Allows each component (web server, application server, and database) to scale independently, and if one server fails, others continue to operate.

Summary:
The infrastructure includes a load balancer cluster with multiple HAProxy instances for high availability. Components (web server, application server, and database) are split onto separate servers for better scalability and fault tolerance. This setup ensures that the system can handle increased load, provides redundancy, and minimizes the impact of failures on the overall system.
